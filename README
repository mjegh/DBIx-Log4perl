DBIx-Log4perl version 0.09
==========================

DBIx-Log4perl is an extension for DBI to selectively log SQL, parameters,
result-sets, transactions etc to a Log::Log4perl handle.

You will need the DBI and Log::Log4perl modules first.

Please see the NOTES section in the pod for incompatibilities.

Please make sure you have an up to date Test::More before running the
tests. You will need at least 0.62.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

NOTE: To to a full test you need a working DBI and DBD with access to
a database where you can create a table. Once you have this set up
you should run perl Makefile.PL like this:

perl Makefile.PL --dsn=dsn --user=dbuser --password=dbpassword --table=table

where:

  dsn is a valid DBI connection dsn e.g. dbd::mysql::database
  dbuser is a valid user to access database
  dbpassword is the password for dbuser
    (may be omitted if not password required)
  table is the name of a table to create for testing
    (NOTE: this table will be dropped if it already exists)

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  DBI 1.50
  Log::Log4perl 1.04
  Test::More 0.62
